# Ft_printf_42

Ft_printf is the first project of 42's Algorithm branch. The goal is to practice modular programming by recoding the famous variadic printing function of the LIBC printf().

Here's an example of the format that my ft_printf currently supports:<br>
<i>%[#-0+ ][123456789][.0123456789][lhL][cspdioufxX]</i>
