# Ft_printf_42

Ft_printf is the first project of 42's Algorhythm branch. The goal is to practice modular programming by recoding the famous variadic printing function of the LIBC printf().

Here's an example of the format that my ft_printf currently supports:<br>
<i>%[#-0+ ][123456789][.0123456789][lhL][cspdioufxX]</i>

More details will come once I've added the functionnalities I'm planning on implementing. (Colour management, file descriptor management, ws_printf() and multibyte chars)

For further details, see [printf(man3)](http://manpagesfr.free.fr/man/man3/printf.3.html)
